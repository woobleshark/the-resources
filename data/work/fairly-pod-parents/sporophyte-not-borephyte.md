Title
Creating an Infographic by Mushtaaq: How to Make the Rise of the Sporophyte not a BOREophyte
Description
After a Visual Teaching Seminar on the properties of a good infographic, I was inspired to learn how to use tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. In particular, I wanted to learn more about creating infographics as a form of science communication. Under the tutelage of Snow, I have been working on creating an infographic on Plant Evolution and documenting and reflecting on the steps involved.
Rationale
Infographics have utility inherently, as they are a way to convey information easily and in a concise way.
Both students and teachers can use infographics as a way of synthesizing information and conveying information, respectively.
By doing this exercise, I have learned a lot about certain tools, specifically Illustrator.
Done
I’m currently working on creating graphics for the layout that we drew up
Initial brainstorm session

Refined layout design

Final layout design

Here are some screenshots of some example graphics:
Algae

Chloroplasts


Doing
By the end of this week (11/22), I’d like the rough draft to be completed
The following two weeks will be my documentation process, which will likely just be me writing an article-esque piece on the process. This way, I can work remotely if I can’t make it to the Bok Center.
Community
The feedback that would be most helpful is very easily done with this cohort of LLUFs! There are a gradient of non-biology students to those who have taken one or two (Shivi) to a resident plant person (Sophie Webster). I hope to get feedback from all of them to see what information they take away. Part of infographic design (that I learned from this process) is you need to have a specific audience in mind. My ideal audience is someone taking a biology class who was overwhelmed and wanted a tight synthesis, but I have also been keeping in mind non-biology people, by avoiding excessive jargon! (Thanks to Snow for calling me out when I do!)
Gallery
I’ll print out copies of my rough draft infographic.
I’m unsure of the documentation right now, it could be just as an article or a powerpoint presentation slide deck. Any feedback is welcome!
