Tips from [this site](https://www.ehow.com/how_12098299_make-paper-mache-sculpture-chicken-wire.html):

Choose a lighter gauge and smaller mesh, like 19 gauge with a 1-inch mesh, for smaller sculptures. A heavier wire like 22 gauge with a 2-inch mesh might suit you better for larger pieces.

The chicken wire forms an integral part of the process, therefore it is important to first loosen the chicken wire, then unroll it and have it ready for use. The chicken wire frame will first need to be constructed before we can begin getting into the paper mache. Tools needed would be a set of pliers and wire cutters. Gloves should also be worn. The correct size of chicken wire would then need to be cut in order to facilitate the size and shape of your artwork. Extra pieces of wire can be used to fill up any missing spaces. One option is to make use of duct tape to cover any sharp edges. This is especially important when working with children.
The water and chosen adhesive solution should be thoroughly mixed and the pieces of paper torn. The sizes of the torn up paper will vary greatly, depending on your individual vision. The torn pieces of paper can now be sufficiently covered in the water and adhesive solution, and the layering process should begin. You should allow your first layer to dry out completely and make an attempt to smooth out any and all edges. Depending on your goal, once the above steps are completed, you can fold or scrunch up larger pieces of paper to start giving your sculpture its shape. The larger pieces of paper can be secured with duct tape or masking tape.
Another layer of paper and adhesive solution should be added until the desired shape is attained. The great thing about using chicken wire in a paper mache sculpture is that you can easily add onto the existing sculpture with ease. The material is easy to work with and extremely durable.
