## Bio:
Hi there! I'm a rising junior at Harvard College studying Psychology & Education :) I'm in my first year of LLUF-ing here, and am currently exploring different animation tools and their applications in education! Animation has the ability to transcend the limits of the physical world, depicting scenarios that would otherwise be restricted to our imaginations. I'm particularly interested in how animation may be applied to clarifying and visualizing abstract scientific concepts. This is especially relevant now, with so much new information about Covid-19 that needs to be communicated regularly. I'm super excited to be able to learn more & help contribute to Harvard and beyond!
